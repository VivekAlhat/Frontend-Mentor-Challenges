## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to make a component accessible and add keyboard navigation.

### Continued development

I will spend some time on checking how to make design look better on smaller screen sizes (320px). Currently it works well on 350px.
