## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

This is the first time I have used Tailwind outside of React/NextJS. I learned how to setup Tailwind and watch for real time changes.
I brushed up basic syntax and learned some responsive flow techniques.

### Continued development

I will be focusing much more on layouts in future projects. I also need to dive deep into color theory and typography.
