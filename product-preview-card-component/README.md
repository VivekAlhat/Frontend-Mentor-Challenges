## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

This challenge was easy but a little tricky for me, especially while doing image part.
I learned how to set background images dynamically using Tailwind. I also learned to extend Tailwind theme to include images and multiple fonts.

### Continued development

I will continue working on layouts and images.
