## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

### What I learned

I learned Tailwind grid, setting opacity when modal/popover is opened, staggering animation using Framer Motion, and custom media query hook.

### Continued development

I will continue using the same stack. This time I made use of atomic design pattern. I will frequently make use of it as I kind of liked it. I will also learn bits and pieces of animating with Framer Motion.
